### 1a. Communication

We will be working together using Discord and text to ensure everyone is up to date and able to continue working on the assignment.

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort:
- Sample Sort: This algorithm splits up the dataset into smaller sample sizes and sorts these smaller groups using something like merge or quick sort. This sorting can be parallelized using OpenMPI to speed up this process. Once these groups are sorted they are merged together to yeild a fully sorted list.
- Merge Sort (Quenton Hua): Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that recursively divides a list into two halves, sorts each half, and merges the sorted halves to produce a sorted list. To parallelize Merge Sort with OpenMPI, the dataset will be divided into smaller chunks, each assigned to different processors. Each processor sorts its chunk independently which is then merged in parallel.
- Radix Sort (Mohsin Khan): This algorithm processes the dataset by sorting elements based on individual digits, starting from the least significant digit. The sorting of each digit can be parallelized using OpenMPI to speed up the process. After each digit is sorted, the data is redistributed across processes to ensure the correct order for the next digit. Once all digits have been processed, the result is a fully sorted list.

- Column Sort: is a parallel sorting algorithm for sorting multi-dimensional data in a matrix. The unsorted input array is split among multiple processors. Each processor sorts its own column of data. The matrix is transposed, so each processor now sorts its row. The matrix is transposed back to its original form, and the processor sort again, giving a fully sorted matrix.

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm

- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes
- Bitonic Sort-

```
code
```

- Sample Sort-

```
def parallel_sample_sort()
    initialize_parallel_environment()

    num_procs = get_num_processors()
    rank = get_processor_rank()

    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    dataset = [provided data]
    gathered_samples = gather_samples_from_all_processors(dataset) #Split data
    if (rank == ROOT) {
        splitters = select_splitters(gathered_samples, num_procs) #Split collected data among all processors
    }
    exchanged_data = parallel_merge_sort(splitters) #Sort individual samples on parallel processors using merge sort
    local_sorted_data = merge_received_partitions(exchanged_data) #Combine results and sort

    global_sorted_data = gather_sorted_data(local_sorted_data) #Clean up returned data

return global_sorted_data

```

- Merge Sort-

```
code
```

- Radix Sort-

```
Initialize MPI environment
MPI_Init()

Get rank of current process and the total number of processes
MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank)
MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size)

Master process initializes the data array if rank == 0 (master process)
if rank == 0 THEN
    Initialize the fullArray with N elements
end if

Broadcast the size of the data (N) to all processes using MPI_Bcast
MPI_Bcast(&N, 1, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD)

Divide the data into chunks for each process
subArraySize = N / size
Allocate memory for subArray of size subArraySize

Use MPI_Scatter to distribute parts of the full array from the master process to each process
MPI_Scatter(fullArray, subArraySize, MPI_INT, subArray, subArraySize, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD)

Find the maximum number in the local subArray to determine the number of digits
local_max = find_max(subArray)
Use MPI_Allreduce to find the global maximum value across all processes
MPI_Allreduce(&local_max, &global_max, 1, MPI_INT, MPI_MAX, MPI_COMM_WORLD)

For each digit (starting from the least significant digit) until the most significant digit:
exp = 1
while global_max / exp > 0 do

    Perform counting sort on the current digit (exp) for the local subArray
    local_counting_sort(subArray, subArraySize, exp)

    Redistribute the data among processes based on the current digit using MPI_Alltoall
    MPI_Alltoall(local_data, subArraySize, MPI_INT, received_data, subArraySize, MPI_INT, MPI_COMM_WORLD)

    Update subArray with redistributed received_data for the next round
    subArray = received_data

    exp = exp * 10
end while

Optionally, gather all sorted subarrays at the master process using MPI_Gather
if rank == 0 THEN
    MPI_Gather(subArray, subArraySize, MPI_INT, fullArray, subArraySize, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD)
end if

Master process prints the fully sorted array
if rank == 0 THEN
    print sorted fullArray
end if

Finalize MPI environment
MPI_Finalize()
```

- Column Sort-

```
Input: A matrix M with n x n elements where n  is the total number of elements distributed among p processors
Output: A fully sorted matrix

  1. Distribute the matrix rows among processes using `MPI_Scatter`.
  2. Repeat these steps until sorted:
     - for each column in the local matrix:
       - Sort the column elements in ascending order.
     - Transpose the local matrix (rows become columns and columns become rows).
     - for each row in the local submatrix:
       - Sort the row elements in ascending order.
     - Use `MPI_Alltoall` to exchange rows among processes.
     - After each exchange, each process will have a subset of rows in the correct order.
     - Transpose the local submatrix again to get the original form.
     - for each column in the local submatrix:
       - Sort the column elements in ascending order.
  3. Gather all submatrices from processes into the root process using `MPI_Gather`.
  4. If the current process is the root process:
     - Print the fully sorted matrix.
  5. Finalize the MPI environment using `MPI_Finalize`.
```

- Merge Sort-

```
function parallelMerge(subArray, subArraySize, rank, size):
       Perform parallel merging in a tree
       step = 1
       while step < size do
           if rank % (2 * step) == 0 then
               // Check if the neighboring process (rank + step) exists
               if rank + step < size then
                      // Receive the sorted sub-array from the neighboring process
                      MPI_Recv(receive_buffer, subArraySize, MPI_INT, rank + step, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE)

                      // Merge the received sub-array with the local sub-array
                      mergedArray = merge(subArray, receive_buffer)

                      // Update local sub-array with the merged result
                      subArray = mergedArray
                      subArraySize = subArraySize * 2
               end if
           else
               // Send the local sorted sub-array to the neighboring process (rank - step)
               MPI_Send(subArray, subArraySize, MPI_INT, rank - step, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD)
               // Exit the loop once the array is sent
               break
           end if
           // Move to the next step in the merging process
           step = step * 2
       end while
```

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare

- Input sizes, Input types: We will use various input sizes to evaluate the performance of each parallel sorting algorithm. The input sizes will follow powers of two: `2^16, 2^18, 2^20, 2^22, 2^24, 2^26, 2^28`.
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes): We will measure **strong scaling** by fixing the input size and increasing the number of processors. We will evaluate how the runtime decreases as we increase the number of MPI processes from `2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, to 1024` for the same input sizes. This will help us determine how well the algorithms use additional processors.
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors): We will increase the problem size and the number of processors proportionally, aiming to keep the workload per processor constant. By comparing the runtimes as we increase both input size and number of processors, we can evaluate the algorithms' ability to handle larger datasets without increasing the per-processor workload.

### 3a. Caliper instrumentation

Please use the caliper build `/scratch/group/csce435-f24/Caliper/caliper/share/cmake/caliper`
(same as lab2 build.sh) to collect caliper files for each experiment you run.

Your Caliper annotations should result in the following calltree
(use `Thicket.tree()` to see the calltree):

```
main
|_ data_init_X      # X = runtime OR io
|_ comm
|    |_ comm_small
|    |_ comm_large
|_ comp
|    |_ comp_small
|    |_ comp_large
|_ correctness_check
```

Required region annotations:

- `main` - top-level main function.
  - `data_init_X` - the function where input data is generated or read in from file. Use _data_init_runtime_ if you are generating the data during the program, and _data_init_io_ if you are reading the data from a file.
  - `correctness_check` - function for checking the correctness of the algorithm output (e.g., checking if the resulting data is sorted).
  - `comm` - All communication-related functions in your algorithm should be nested under the `comm` region.
    - Inside the `comm` region, you should create regions to indicate how much data you are communicating (i.e., `comm_small` if you are sending or broadcasting a few values, `comm_large` if you are sending all of your local values).
    - Notice that auxillary functions like MPI_init are not under here.
  - `comp` - All computation functions within your algorithm should be nested under the `comp` region.
    - Inside the `comp` region, you should create regions to indicate how much data you are computing on (i.e., `comp_small` if you are sorting a few values like the splitters, `comp_large` if you are sorting values in the array).
    - Notice that auxillary functions like data_init are not under here.
  - `MPI_X` - You will also see MPI regions in the calltree if using the appropriate MPI profiling configuration (see **Builds/**). Examples shown below.

All functions will be called from `main` and most will be grouped under either `comm` or `comp` regions, representing communication and computation, respectively. You should be timing as many significant functions in your code as possible. **Do not** time print statements or other insignificant operations that may skew the performance measurements.

### **Nesting Code Regions Example** - all computation code regions should be nested in the "comp" parent code region as following:

```
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp");
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp_small");
sort_pivots(pivot_arr);
CALI_MARK_END("comp_small");
CALI_MARK_END("comp");

# Other non-computation code
...

CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp");
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp_large");
sort_values(arr);
CALI_MARK_END("comp_large");
CALI_MARK_END("comp");
```

### **Calltree Example**:

```
# MPI Mergesort
4.695 main
├─ 0.001 MPI_Comm_dup
├─ 0.000 MPI_Finalize
├─ 0.000 MPI_Finalized
├─ 0.000 MPI_Init
├─ 0.000 MPI_Initialized
├─ 2.599 comm
│  ├─ 2.572 MPI_Barrier
│  └─ 0.027 comm_large
│     ├─ 0.011 MPI_Gather
│     └─ 0.016 MPI_Scatter
├─ 0.910 comp
│  └─ 0.909 comp_large
├─ 0.201 data_init_runtime
└─ 0.440 correctness_check
```

### 3b. Collect Metadata

Have the following code in your programs to collect metadata:

```
adiak::init(NULL);
adiak::launchdate();    // launch date of the job
adiak::libraries();     // Libraries used
adiak::cmdline();       // Command line used to launch the job
adiak::clustername();   // Name of the cluster
adiak::value("algorithm", algorithm); // The name of the algorithm you are using (e.g., "merge", "bitonic")
adiak::value("programming_model", programming_model); // e.g. "mpi"
adiak::value("data_type", data_type); // The datatype of input elements (e.g., double, int, float)
adiak::value("size_of_data_type", size_of_data_type); // sizeof(datatype) of input elements in bytes (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
adiak::value("input_size", input_size); // The number of elements in input dataset (1000)
adiak::value("input_type", input_type); // For sorting, this would be choices: ("Sorted", "ReverseSorted", "Random", "1_perc_perturbed")
adiak::value("num_procs", num_procs); // The number of processors (MPI ranks)
adiak::value("scalability", scalability); // The scalability of your algorithm. choices: ("strong", "weak")
adiak::value("group_num", group_number); // The number of your group (integer, e.g., 1, 10)
adiak::value("implementation_source", implementation_source); // Where you got the source code of your algorithm. choices: ("online", "ai", "handwritten").
```

They will show up in the `Thicket.metadata` if the caliper file is read into Thicket.

### **See the `Builds/` directory to find the correct Caliper configurations to get the performance metrics.** They will show up in the `Thicket.dataframe` when the Caliper file is read into Thicket.

## 4. Performance evaluation

Include detailed analysis of computation performance, communication performance.
Include figures and explanation of your analysis.

### 4a. Vary the following parameters

For input_size's:

- 2^16, 2^18, 2^20, 2^22, 2^24, 2^26, 2^28

For input_type's:

- Sorted, Random, Reverse sorted, 1%perturbed

MPI: num_procs:

- 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024

This should result in 4x7x10=280 Caliper files for your MPI experiments.

### 4b. Hints for performance analysis

To automate running a set of experiments, parameterize your program.

- input_type: "Sorted" could generate a sorted input to pass into your algorithms
- algorithm: You can have a switch statement that calls the different algorithms and sets the Adiak variables accordingly
- num_procs: How many MPI ranks you are using

When your program works with these parameters, you can write a shell script
that will run a for loop over the parameters above (e.g., on 64 processors,
perform runs that invoke algorithm2 for Sorted, ReverseSorted, and Random data).

### 4c. You should measure the following performance metrics

- `Time`
  - Min time/rank
  - Max time/rank
  - Avg time/rank
  - Total time
  - Variance time/rank

## 5. Presentation

Plots for the presentation should be as follows:

- For each implementation:
  - For each of comp_large, comm, and main:
    - Strong scaling plots for each input_size with lines for input_type (7 plots - 4 lines each)
    - Strong scaling speedup plot for each input_type (4 plots)
    - Weak scaling plots for each input_type (4 plots)

Analyze these plots and choose a subset to present and explain in your presentation.

## 6. Final Report

Submit a zip named `TeamX.zip` where `X` is your team number. The zip should contain the following files:

- Algorithms: Directory of source code of your algorithms.
- Data: All `.cali` files used to generate the plots seperated by algorithm/implementation.
- Jupyter notebook: The Jupyter notebook(s) used to generate the plots for the report.
- Report.md
